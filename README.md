## Design Approach

### 1. **Responsive Layout**
- Used **Bootstrap Grid System** for responsiveness across devices.
- Ensured tables adapt to different screen sizes for optimal user experience.

### 2. **Code Structure**
- **HTML**: Structured to segregate content into distinct sections (Dogs, Big Cats, Big Fish).
- **CSS**: Used custom styles for hover effects, image scaling, and consistent design aesthetics.
- **JavaScript**: Encapsulated logic into reusable classes and methods for easier maintenance and scalability.

### 3. **Validation**
- Prevent duplicate entries by comparing new data with existing entries.
- Enforced proper data types for fields like `size` (numeric validation).
- Ensured all fields (species, size, image) are filled before submission.

### 4. **User Experience**
- Added dynamic hover effects on images for better interaction.
- Highlighted animal names in bold or stylized text based on the tableâ€™s specifications.
